	what is the objective of the project
	is that all positive coreelation? in respect to happiness.
	we need to see if the relationships make sense.
	We would need to explain each result.
	Add P-values or some form of significance indicator.
	Add a lot of tables and graphs to explain
	report regression and neural network result
	add both expected and unexpected results
	failed and successful predictors.
	(price + fees)* days filled = revenue
	display your table to show the class
	statistical summary of data
	we are going to show images in a powerpoint, not the pure code in an IDE
	have everything printed out prior
	compare side by side the MSE, R^2, correlation, accuracy, certainty, ect 
	python librarys perform better
	correlation table
	Again Statistical summary

	compare logistic and neural categorical for MF
	compare logistic and neural for Superhost
	use linear regression on amenities output price.

	location data map in neural network.
	Break down the geographic data into a 100x100 grid.
	flatten the data
	create neural network
	compare to KNN

	Objective: find if gender matters, if superhost matters, and what factors influence price/revenue
